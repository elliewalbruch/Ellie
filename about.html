                        <p>From a very young age I started to play soccer. My older brother played and I wanted to be just like him. Kyle and I would practice together and we would always be competing. I played on rec teams till I was about 7 and then I joined more competive teams where we would travel all over Utah to play. I did that for a few years playing up a age group because that was the only way to challenge myself. I then decided it was time to join a travelling team which I did still playing up an age group. I joined a team named LaRoca.</p>
                        <p>Once I joined LaRoca, I became capatain and lead my team to a lot of tournaments and showcases, showing our skill to college coaches and US scouts. This team was the best way to get exposure to the highest level and I enjoyed every second of it. I was recruited very early and ended up deciding to commit to college my freshmen year. I committed to play for UCLA and it was a dream come true. !</p>
                        <p>After I committed, the real work began. I got better and better and ended up graaduating highschool early and going to UCLA a semester early. Our team was stacked. I was competing with the best girls in the US and that year we ended up winning the NCAA championship where we were crowned champions. That has been a dream of mine ever since I was a little girl. I then decided I was going to transfer and come back home and go to BYU. This last year was nothing short of speical. We made it the College Cup and lost in the Semifinals of the NCAA, but it was so fun because I had an amazing season and was led by some amazing people. </p>
